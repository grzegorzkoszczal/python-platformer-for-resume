Nothing to see, for now


WHAT TO DO:

1. Finish the README.md file
2. Add more comment at the beginning of the main.py
3. Add more comment thorough the entire code
4. Add .exe of the game for quick start and run
5. Add info in terms of how to set up virtual env and download dependencies (use bash for this)
6. Create bash script that will create virtual env (preferably, already integrated with
    some sort of text editor, like VS Code), pull the dependencies, show messages in terminal
    and what not and allow for fast and easy setup for next developer for work
